# Overview

As a software engineer improving my skills, I created a minimal Python program to practice language basics, working with Unicode (emojis), and the local development workflow (edit → run → document). The project helps reinforce fundamental concepts and quick iteration habits useful for larger projects.

This software is a tiny "Hello World" script that demonstrates Python syntax, list usage, string interpolation, and printing Unicode emoji characters.

# Development Environment

Tools: Visual Studio Code (editor), Terminal (zsh) for running scripts, and Git for version control.
Platform: macOS (local development).
Language: Python (3.14.2). The script uses only core language features and needs no external packages.
